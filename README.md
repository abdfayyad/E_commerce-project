We have four actors in the system, the first is the admin, who adds, displays and manages products in the application, and also adds and displays deliveries. The orders requested by the customer can be displayed and shipped to him, and he can specify the delivery person who delivers them to him. The second is the provider, who the admin adds to the system and adds and displays products. The admin can also have a percentage of the profit on each product he sells. The third is the delivery person, who displays the products he delivered to customers and confirms the order arrival process. The fourth is the customer, who displays all the products in the system and adds what he wants to his basket and buys all the products in this basket
